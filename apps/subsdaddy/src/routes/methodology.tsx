        <p>tokens = input + cache creation + cache read + output, per row. Cache share = cache read ÷ (input + cache creation + cache read).</p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-medium">Capacity</h2>
        <p>window_snapshot: tokens delivered in the current quota window ÷ used fraction, normalized to a week. Requires ≥95% log coverage of the elapsed window. A saturated (100%) or unused window is refused, not extrapolated. Delta pairs (two readings ≥1 h apart) are the fallback. The 5-hour window is never used for capacity.</p>

      <section className="space-y-2">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-medium">$/B</h2>
        <p>usd per billion tokens = monthly fee ÷ (weekly tokens × 4.348) × 10⁹. Ranking key is the measured mix.</p>

      <section className="space-y-2">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-medium">Two speed layers</h2>
        <p>The measured layer comes only from our usage_logs (lane p50 TTFT, p90 TTFT, output tok/s). The OR p50 layer comes only from OpenRouter's public model page. No value is computed from both, and the two are never averaged or calibrated against each other.</p>

      <section className="space-y-2">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-medium">Plans catalog</h2>
        <p>The catalog lists published prices and published allowance models for plans we have not measured. A catalog row has no local token count, so it is not ranked and carries no $/B. Unverified prices show as "unverified", never as zero. Where a plan's allowance is in credits and the dollar value per credit is published, the derivation is shown (example: CommandCode GOAT, $10 for $80 of usage, so $0.125 per credit). Excluded rows (pay-as-you-go, or monthly plans no longer sold) stay listed with the reason.</p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
          <li>Unpriced rows (total_cost = 0) are excluded from the price fit and counted.</li>
          <li>Seed allowances are badged and kept out of the measured ranking.</li>
          <li>OpenRouter's stats payload is unofficial and can change; rows with missing stats are stale and excluded, never zero.</li>
          <li>No quality score is published; the dataset has no quality field.</li>
